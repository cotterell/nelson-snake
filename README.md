Faculty mentored research project under the guidance of Dr. Michael Cotterell of the UGA
Department of Computer Science. Files related to research, "Analyzing Varying
Complexity on Q-Learning". 

For an in-depth tutorial into the creation of these files and instructions to
repeat the same experiments can be found on [my
website](http://baileydnelson.com/qlearning). 

The goal of this project is not only to examine the effectiveness on the
Q-Learning algorithm, but to also provide an available method to allow other
students the ability to jump into experimenting and understanding Q-Learning.
